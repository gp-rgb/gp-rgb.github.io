# detecting AI-generated images with Deep Learning

the third part of the elec4630 assigment tasks us with generating a model that can tell the difference between an AI-generated image and a real one. exciting!

## dataset

Jordan Bird's CIFAKE dataset on Kaggle provides 20000 real and fake images, which is perfect for our task. i decided to use the kaggle development environment for this question, as it allows me to import the dataset directly (without the need for downloading it).

## model selection

i'm planning on testing many hyperparameters within fastai's vision_learner object, including:

* architecture (resnet, densenet, etc.)
* loss function (cross-entropy, label smoothing cross-entropy)
* optimisation function (adam, sgd, etc.)
* number of layers (resnet18, 34 and 50, etc.)

Since the CIFAKE dataset is so large, the training time on the whole dataset is simply too long to perform many times over during the experimentation stage. a subset of 2000 images was taken in order to reduce training time. it was assumed that choosing an optimised model for the small dataset would "scale up" to be the optimal model for the large dataset.
