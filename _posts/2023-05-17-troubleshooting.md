# environment change

been having a lot of difficulties with github codespaces being really really slow to set up, and issues with it not saving progress when losing access to wifi.

moved to google colab for question 2, and kaggle for question 3... just to keep things interesting! kaggle has good support for importing the cifake dataset in-place so I don't have to store it locally. colab has some nice free GPU availability.

## question 2 progress

got some really nice metrics for question 2. confusion matrix makes it really easy to see the classes most likely to be misclassified. as i suspected, most misclassifications occur between animals of the same taxinomical class (birds, reptiles, marsupials, etc.).

## question 3 progress

moved to kaggle for this one, as there's a cifake dataset built-in. training takes an awfully long time on resnet50 over resnet18. will keep you updated on resnet50 performance, as well as ways of improving that eventual model.
